  *Note: I'm currently working on this. I broke it recently and needed to start from scratch. Stand by - 7/5/21
  
  Hi, my name's Rob. I'm a pretty good Systems Administrator with experience with independently managing 300+ Windows based work stations & laptops, 100+ iOS & Android devices, and 200+ VoIP and Cell Phones simultaneously. Most of my background is in managing and deploying Windows based devices.
  
  When I'm not working with enterprise systems, I'm spending time working on my HomeLab which runs <mark>Linux Servers</mark> with <mark>Docker</mark> docker <mark>Kubernetes</mark> for the various web services I run. There have been a few iterations to my <.mark>homelab</mark> that have seen different <mark>VPN</mark> servers, an occasional <mark>ESXi</mark> host, a few different <mark>Raspberry Pi</mark> or <mark>Arduino</mark> setups.

  The primary technologies I use daily or are most proficient in include: Microsoft <mark>SCCM</mark> & related Deployment Tools, Cisco <mark>Meraki MDM</mark> w/ <mark>Apple Business Manager</mark>, Microsoft <mark>Windows 10</mark> & Apple <mark>macOS/ iOS</mark>, Ubiquity <mark>Unifi</mark> Network Manager & Hardware, VMware vSphere <mark>ESXi 6.7</mark> and other related VMWare Products and (<mark>VEEAM</mark>).

          It's the full stack with a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running the controller software. A wireless mesh network was recently setup with two AP's. The network has a guest wifi, IoT wifi, and the VLAN configuration to secure the traffic with blocking on the firewall. Thanks to the Extremis Project, the network is also protected by a PiHole, has PiVPN, and other home automation services that require this gear to function properly.
